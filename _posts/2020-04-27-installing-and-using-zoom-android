*By Didi Mudigdo*

In this video, we walk you through the process of installing Zoom on your android tablet (Samsung, Lenovo etc.), and using it to attend your SPLC online course. This procedure also applies to non-Apple smartphones (Samsung etc.), although we don't recommend you attending an SPLC online course using a smartphone (unless you are mirroring your smartphone to a large screen TV).

If you are an iPad owner, the instructions on using Zoom to attend SPLC classes (from 3:18 onwards) will also apply to you.
