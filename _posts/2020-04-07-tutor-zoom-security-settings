Feeling insecure about Zoom security? Fear not, it all comes down to your settings. 


With the rise in the popularity of Zoom, according to Reuters, from 10 million to over 200 million users in three months, there have also been concerns regarding the security of Zoom.

For many large corporations and universities around the world, this has not created unease, they have simply released instructions on how to keep meetings private and reduce the chance of what is now known as Zoombombing. We have briefed all our facilitators here at SPLC on these procedures. From your end, as a student participant in a Zoom class meeting, here are four things you can do to help secure your class meeting.
1. Update your Zoom software
On MacOS: Open your Zoom software, and go to the ‘zoom.us’ menu. From that menu, select ‘Check for Updates…’. If you are not up to date, follow the prompts to get the latest, most secure version of Zoom.
On Windows PC: If you have an account, open your Zoom software and click on your account image in the top right hand corner.  From the drop down list, click on ‘Check for Updates’.  If you are not up to date, follow the prompts to get the latest, most secure version of Zoom.
2. Be wary of ‘phishing’
‘Phishing’ is the practice of tricking someone to click a malicious link in an e-mail. When you receive a link for a meeting from your tutor, make sure that e-mail actually came from your tutor. Then, make sure the link looks like “https://zoom.us/...” followed by a string of nine numbers. To be doubly sure, if you are using a browser-based e-mail (e.g. hotmail/gmail) hover your mouse over that link, and look at the bottom left hand corner of your browser. It should also say “https://zoom.us/...”, again followed by a string of numbers.

The next two security precautions are initiated by your tutor, however you should be aware of its repercussions, as things may look different than before.
3. Password protection
Previously, tutors may not have password-protected your Zoom class meetings. Now as a security initiative, our tutor will provide you with a password for the meeting by email. You will be asked for this password when you join the Zoom class meeting.

4. Waiting room
Previously, when you clicked the Zoom link in the link, you were immediately brought to the online meeting. As another security initiative, you will now be placed in a Zoom virtual Waiting Room, so you will need to wait until your tutor admits you into the meeting.

These four steps, along with the procedures taken by your tutor will ensure a safe and secure class meeting. If you have any concerns or issues, please feel free to contact us at South Perth Learning Centre.
