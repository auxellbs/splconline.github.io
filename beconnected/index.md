## Apple iPad
iPads need little explanation, they have revolutionised consumer use and engagement with the internet. Most recommended for people who already use an iPhone, and would like to explore using an iPhone-ish device with a larger screen. [More info](https://www.apple.com/au/ipad-10.2/){:target="_blank"}
 
## Lenovo Chromebook Laptop
A Chromebook is a simple pared down laptop that is mostly an internet browser. They are suited to members who are more comfortable exploring the internet using a device with a keyboard, mouse and a larger screen (rather than a touchscreen device).

## Samsung Pocket Tablet
Our Samsung Galaxy 7-inch tablets are more portable (the size of a pocket book) and run Google's Android OS. If you are vacillating between a larger (10 inch) and smaller (7 inch) device, and/or are used to an Android phone, try borrowing this device.

## Lenovo Smart Display
Our state of the art voice activated Smart Display devices are the next tech iteration for everyday users. You use it by speaking to it: "what's the weather like tomorrow?", "play some Cliff Richard", "show me a lasagna recipe" (for privacy concerns, there is a physical off-switch for the microphone). for those curious about the latest in Artificial Intelligence!
