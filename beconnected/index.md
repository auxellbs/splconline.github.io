### Getting Rid of Your Clutter on Gumtree
*1 pm Wed 21st & 28th July (Aug-Sep dates TBA)*  
Want to try a new way to get rid of your clutter? In this 1-hour course you will learn how to sell (or give away) your clutter on gumtree.com.au, a uniquely Australian online classifieds site that was founded over 20 years ago by antipodeans living in the UK. Unlike eBay, Gumtree focuses mainly on local transactions where goods are handed over directly and paid in cash, much like regular classifieds. So come to this FREE course, and join the millions of Australians selling locally on Gumtree!
