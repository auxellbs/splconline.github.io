---

If your Term 1 South Perth Learning Centre course was affected when we closed on the evening of 20th March 2020 due to COVID-19, you can apply for a partial credit toward future courses, as per our terms and conditions set out in [splc.org.au/about/terms-and-conditions](http://splc.org.au/about/terms-and-conditions).

Please note that requests for refunds are assessed on a case by case basis, and if make up classes for your course were already offered online, course credit refunds are only offered under extenuating circumstances.
