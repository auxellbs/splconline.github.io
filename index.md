As a response to COVID-19, the South Perth Learning Centre is committed to keeping our community connected during this challenging time. This SPLC Online website, auxilliary to our [main website](http://splc.org.au){:target="_blank"} is one of the many online engagement initiatives that we are currently working on. For now, it is the 'launching pad' for the following (click the titles to launch):

**[SPLC Blog](/blog)** A collection of articles written by our staff, tutors and students, since the SPLC COVID-19 lockdown on 20th March 2020.

**[SPLC Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/splcinc){:target="_blank"}** Our presence on Facebook.

**SPLC Facebook Group** (coming soon) The above Facebook Page is a place for us to make announcements, but the Facebook Group will be a virtual community of SPLC staff, tutors and students where everyone can have a say.

**[SPLC TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZuGsnJ8e1OG6SCYH82mdQ){:target="_blank"}** The SPLC YouTube channel.
