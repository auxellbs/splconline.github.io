<p>As a response to COVID-19, the South Perth Learning Centre is committed to keeping our community connected during this challenging time. This SPLC Online website, auxilliary to our main website is one of the many initiatives that we are currently working on. For now, it is the 'launching pad' for:</p>

<p><strong>[SPLC Blog](/blog)</strong> A collection of articles written by our staff, tutors and students, since the SPLC COVID-19 lockdown on 20th March 2020</p>

<p><strong>[SPLC Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/splcinc)</strong> Our presence on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>SPLC Facebook Group</strong> (coming soon) The above Facebook Page is a place for us to make announcements, but the Facebook Group is a virtual community of SPLC staff, tutors and students where everyone can have a say.</p>

<p><strong>SPLC TV</strong> (coming soon) The SPLC YouTube channel.</p>
